## Forecasting the Standardized Precipitation Index using Long-Short Term Memory Networks (LSTMs)

In this reposity, we fit an LSTM model to forecast the stationary and the non-stationary version of the standardized precipitation index. 

This implementation is based on the publication ["Characterization of Bias during Meteorological Drought Calculation in Time Series Out-of-Sample Validation"](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/13/18/2531) and the implementation of the R package: [droughtR](https://github.com/mammask/droughtR).
